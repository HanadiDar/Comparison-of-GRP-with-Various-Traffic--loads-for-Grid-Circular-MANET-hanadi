Performance Evaluation and Comparison of GRP Routing Protocol with Various Traffic loads for Grid and Circular Node Placement Models Over Mobile Ad Hoc Networks Using OPNET 14.5.Keywords: Mobile Ad hoc Networks, routing protocol , various Traffic loads, GRP, Node Placement Models.@Article{Darwisho2020, journal="International Journal of Computer Science Trends and Technology (IJCST)", issn="2347-8578", volume="8", number="6", year="2020", title="Performance Evaluation and Comparison of GRP Routing Protocol with Various Traffic loads for Grid and Circular Node Placement Models Over Mobile Ad Hoc Networks Using OPNET 14.5",abstract="Due to the increased use of mobile devices with the high demand for applications , most companies have tended to pay attention to Mobile Ad hoc Networks . This type of network is characterized by multi-hop wireless networks where data packets are sent in a "store and forward" manner from the source to an arbitrary destination via intermediate nodes.
The mobile nodes are connected by multi-routes routing as the nodes in this network not only serve as hosts but also as routers where data is routed to and from other nodes in the network and therefore the mobile node not only sends its data packets but also sends data packets of other mobile nodes . The network architecture changes dynamically, mainly because of Mobility of nodes , so we need routing protocols to establish the connection. Routing protocols are categorized
into proactive routing protocols , reactive routing protocols and hybrid routing protocols .So in this paper, we has been studied GRP routing protocol which is one of hybrid routing protocols with using grid node placement model and circular node placement model on the basis of Wireless LAN and GRP Statistics and
evaluated the performance in a large network and in a small network"., author="Darwisho, Hanadi ", pages="63-85, doi="10.33144/23478578/IJCST-V8I6P11", url="www.ijcstjournal.org"
